"""19: Optimize Imports

Automate the organizing and cleaning up of your Python imports with Optimize Imports.

- Problems:

    - One unused import

    - Unsorted import list, per group

    - I want multiple per line

- Optimize Imports (``Command-Alt-O`` macOS)

- Undo/Redo

- Split imports  via
  ``Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Python | Imports``

  - ``Structure of "from" imports`` -> ``Always split imports``
